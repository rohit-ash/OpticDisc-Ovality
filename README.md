# Abstract

Optic disc tilt (ODT), increased ovality, peripapillary atrophy, and abnormally large or small optic discs are the earliest known reported changes in myopic eyes. Studies of these early changes may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of myopia progression. The study aims to investigate if there is a relationship between the ODT and ovality in myopes. ODT. The ovality index was quantified in myopic eyes (n=33) and compared with 21 emmetropic eyes. The myopic OCT images were labelled based on a severity scale as low-moderate (between -0.50 D to -6.00 D SE) and high-myopia (worse than -6.00 D SE) using standard myopia classifications. From segmented OCT images of the optic nerve head, the optic disc boundary was extracted by traversing all the pixels of the image and selecting only those pixels with an intensity value lower than 30 in all 3 color channels. Then, an ellipse was fit to the extracted optic disc boundaries using an automated image processing method. From these the long and short axes of the ellipses were measured. Using this measurement ODT and ovality were calculated. Higher ODT was observed with the shorter axis in low-moderate myopic eyes 18.15 (IQR 15.83 – 23.81) and smaller ODT was observed in the high-myopic eye’s longer axis 11.83 (IQR 7.20 – 14.39). A significantly altered ovality index was observed with increase in degree of myopia.
